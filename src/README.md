# FBLA Website Coding & Development: VibeMagnet
### Hello, judges! It is an honor for us to be able to present to you, and we are incredibly glad to have this opportunity.

Here is the source code for our website, that shows all its inner workings. Our website uses *industry-standard* technologies, including:
- TypeScript & JavaScript
- Next.JS
- TailwindCSS
- Vercel

## Navigating our code
### File explorer
To the very left of this app, is the **file explorer** -- you can scroll through it and look at any of our files. Just click on any file to view its code in the panel!

### Tabs
We already have some of our code open to the left of this guide, in the panel to the left of this one. At the top of the panel, there are _Chrome-like tabs_ that you can also click to see each file, and its code!

## Structure of our code
### Mock data for the business
Located in the `lib` folder, in the file `globalData.js`. Full path: `lib/globalData.js`

### All the images we use
Located in the folder named `public`.

### Actual website code
Located in the folder `src`, and the folder inside that named `app`. Full path: `src/app`.

### Our code for styling the website, and making it look how it looks
Located in the file named `globals.css`, the file named `tailwind.config.ts`, and the file named `postcss.config.js`.

### Miscellaneous
All other files we didn't mention are related to setting up our code!
